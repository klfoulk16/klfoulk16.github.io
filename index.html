      <h2>Hello there!</h2>
      <p> My name's Kelly and welcome to my first ever website. Eventually this site will be a fully fleshed out resume; however, for now it includes information about my travels, my education and my future vision as of December 2019.</p>
      <p>For now it's mainly a sample of my coding capabilities- most of the writing is fluff. I've used CSS for the base style, to make the website mobile friendly (there are three different versions of the site depending on your window size), to make the header sticky, and to create floats. I used html to add and organize the content. I used JavaScript event listeners to create the read more/read less feature in the two float sections. Enjoy!</p>

        <p>Spring 2019 I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Florida State University with a B.S. in International Relations. I concentrated in Spanish and economics. I will potentially head to grad school in a few years to continue my studies with a MBA or a Masters of Economics. However, just because I have graduated doesn't mean I've stopped learning...</p>
        <div id= "more1" style= 'display: none;'><p>Currently I am working on 3 new skills: website development, German, and guitar. I'm interested in working in tech or foreign affairs, but joining a small band and playing in small bars across the southern coast of Spain sounds tempting as well.</p>
          <p>Throughout university I built several Wordpress websites and once classes were over I joined the TeamTreeHouse learning platform to learn how to develop websites from scratch. I'm currently about halfway finished their Front End Web Development course.</p>
          <p>I am also continuing my language education by learning German. I am currently at an A1 level, but I will head to Vienna, Austria in Fall 2019 to immerse myself and work towards fluency.</p>

        <p>The main focus of my life up till now. I have traveled extensively through mainland USA as well as to some European and Central American countries. I plan to continue traveling and expanding my horizons in the coming years...</p>
        <div id= "more2" style= 'display: none;'>
          <p>The past 3 summers I have gone on several RV trips exploring the US. One of my favorite locations was Kodachrome Basin State Park, Utah. Kodachrome is one of the places in the US with the least amount of light pollution, hence the night sky is miraculous. I recommend visiting with the intention of spending the night searching out constellations you might never see again.</p>
          <p>I spent two semesters studying abroad as well- Spring 2017 in Panama City, Panama and Spring 2019 in Alicante, Spain. Both of these semesters were wonderful cultural immersions and have drastically shaped my world views on things such as foreign policy and immigration.</p>
          <p>Through these travel experiences I've faced challenges that made me question who I was, what I want to do, and even whether I would be able to live to see another day. These hardships have taught me resiliency and given me a joy for life that can come only from knowing nothing is guaranteed.</span></p>

        <h2>The Future</h2>
          <p>I hope to find a career that combines my love for travel and building relationships with my desire to constantly learn and be challenged. I've loved learning Front End Development these past few months and based off this I'd love to find a career in technology.  I'm currently exploring work as a solutions architect or in business development.</p>
          <p>My goal is to find a career where I am helping to make the world a better place, but that also is intellectually stimulating and challenging. I plan to be surrounded by a diverse team of passionate and motivated individuals. I want to work for a company that has the same enthusiasm for learning and out-of-the box thinking that I do.</p>
