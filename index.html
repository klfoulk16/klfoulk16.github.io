      <h2>Hello there!</h2>
      <p> My name's Kelly and welcome to my first ever website. I created this site to be a virtual resume, to display all of my accomplishments and my current projects so friends, employers and family have an idea what I'm up to.</p>
      <p>On the site, you will find information about my goals, travels, projects, jobs and education. For example this very site is one of my projects. I'm learning to code websites and have created it from sratch.</p>

        <p>Spring 2019 I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Florida State University with a B.S. in International Relations. I concentrated in Spanish and economics. I will potentially head to grad school in a few years to continue my studies with a MBA or a Masters of Economics. However, just because I have graduated doesn't mean I've stopped learning...</p>
        <div id= "more1" style= 'display: none;'><p>Currently I am working on 3 new skills: website development, German, and guitar. I'm interested in working in tech or foreign affairs, but joining a small band and playing in small bars across the southern coast of Spain sounds tempting as well.</p>
          <p>Throughout university I built several Wordpress websites and once classes were over I joined the TeamTreeHouse learning platform to learn how to develop websites from scratch. I'm currently about halfway finished their Front End Web Development course.</p>
          <p>I am also continueing my language education by learning German. I am currently at an A1 level, but I will head to Vienna, Austria in Fall 2019 to immerse myself and work towards fluency.</p>

        <p>The main focus of my life up till now. I have traveled extensively through mainland USA as well as to some European and Central American countries. I plan to continue traveling and expanding my horizons in the coming years...</p>
        <div id= "more2" style= 'display: none;'>
          <p>The past 3 summers I have gone on several RV trips exploring the US. One of my favorite locations was Kodachrome Basin State Park, Utah. Kodachrome is one of the places in the US with the least amount of light pollution, hence the night sky is miraculous. I recomend visiting with the intention of spending the night searching out constellations you might never see again.</p>
          <p>I spent two semesters studying abroad as well- Spring 2017 in Panama City, Panama and Spring 2019 in Alicante, Spain. Both of these semesters were wonderful cultural immersions and have drastically shaped my world views on things such as foreign policy and immigration.</p>
          <p>Through these travel experiences I've faced challenges that made me question who I was, what I want to do, and even whether I would be able to live to see another day. These hardships have taught me resiliency and given me a joy for life that can come only from knowing nothing is garunteed.</span></p>

        <h2>The Future</h2>
          <p>I am not sure exactly what I intend to pursue in the future, but I am actively working to figure it out. In addition to learning to speak German and code websites, I will be volunteering with International Red Cross and helping with refugees during my upcoming trip to Vienna. I've been interested in a career helping in this area.  I also spent this past summer volunteering for LASOS Harford County, helping recent migrants.</p>
          <p>My goal is to find a career where I am helping to make the world a better place, but that also is intellectually stimulating and challenging. I plan to be surrounded by a diverse team of passionate and motivated individuals.</p>
